  <h3 id="whatisethereum">What is Ethereum</h3>
  <p>From a computer science perspective, Ethereum is a deterministic but practically unbounded state machine, consisting of a globally accessible singleton state and a virtual machine that applies changes to that state.</p>
  <p>From a more practical perspective, Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.</p>
  <p>The Ethereum platform enables developers to build powerful decentralized applications with built-in economic functions. While providing high availability, auditability, transparency, and neutrality, it also reduces or eliminates censorship and reduces certain counterparty risks.</p>
  <h3 id="ethereumnodes">Ethereum Nodes</h3>
  <p>A node means a client</p>
  <p>An Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients. Different Ethereum clients interoperate if they comply with the reference specification and the standardized communications protocols. While these different clients are implemented by different teams and in different programming languages, they all "speak" the same protocol and follow the same rules. As such, they can all be used to operate and interact with the same Ethereum network.</p>
  <h3 id ="ethereumconcensus">Ethereum Consensus Protocols</h3>
  <p>The current Ethereum blockchain uses a consensus algorithm built specifically for the Ethereum blockchain called Ethash. The Ethash PoW algorithm introduces the property of “Memory Hardness” to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
  <p>Memory hardness dictates that your computational performance is limited by how fast your machine can move data around in memory, as opposed to how rapidly it can perform computations. By doing this, the Ethereum blockchain aims to prevent large organizations and large mining pools from obtaining undue influence over the network.</p>
  <h3 id="decentrializedapps">Decentrialized Apps</h3>
  <p>It is relatively easy to establish an Ethereum node, send and receive transactions, trade cryptocurrencies, and bring test environments online, though understanding the moving parts and complexities of such a fledgling technology is a formidable task.</p>

  <h3 id="smartcontracts">Smart Contracts</h3>
  <p>Smart contracts are just computer programs. In the context of Ethereum, smart contracts refer to the source code of EVM-specific, special-purpose programming languages: Solidity, Vyper, LLL, Bamboo, and Serpent.</p>
  <p>There are good reasons for using built-for-purpose languages to write smart contracts, but they will not be discussed in this documentation. To make an attempt at summarizing, due to the minimalistic and constrained nature of the EVM, it's easier to build a special-purpose language from the ground up than it is to bend a general-purpose language to the intricate needs of the EVM.</p>
  <p>Smart contract developers have multiple high level language options at their disposal. In an earlier section, we highlighted the diverse range of Ethereum clients, yet explained that two clients, Geth and Parity, remain the most salient and widely used. The state of Ethereum high-level languages is slightly similar. Solidity is the de facto and most widely used language, while Vyper is emerging as a competitive alternative.</p>

	<h2 id="etherWallet">Why use an Ether wallet?</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>Like other blockchains, Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). 
    ETH is digital money. If you’ve heard of Bitcoin, 
    ETH has many of the same features. 
    It is purely digital, and can be sent to anyone anywhere 
    in the world instantly. The supply of ETH isn’t 
    controlled by any government or company - it is decentralized, and it is scarce. 
    People all over the world use ETH to make payments, 
    as a store of value, or as collateral.</p>
